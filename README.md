- While creating the branch (camelCasing), use first 3 letters of your name then the feature that you are working on, followed by 3 letters of current month and 2 digit date. For example,
  If I am making the branch then darFeatureNameMonthDD, `darBrowserDec03`
- Don't edit on the main branch, you should always ask for merge request for that
- Files names should use PascalCasing
- Never put static datas on the code, always import them from the assets folder
